# Simulation of Space Invaders Game in C++
This project is a simple simulation of the space invaders game that is done by C++ in the Qt platform.
The red boxes are enemies which have shooting ability and the blue boxes are enemies without shooting ability; The enemy shots are white and the player shots are yellow. The spaceship locates at the bottom and the red lines are the trenches. The score and number of remained lives can be seen at the top of the panel, too. An image for the panel layout has been attached.
